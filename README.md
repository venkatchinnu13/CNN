This study presents a deep learning approach for classifying heart sound signals using Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) features. After preprocessing, STFT-based spectral features are extracted and fed into a deep neural network trained on a public dataset. The model is evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, achieving high classification performance for automated cardiovascular disease detection.
